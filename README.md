## Workshop: Containerization with Docker and Singularity

### Date: 
Friday, March 17, 2020, 10:00 am - 3:00 pm

### Location: 

_This course is only offered online_: https://cuboulder.zoom.us/j/699603055  


### Instructors 
Daniel Trahan and Andrew Monaghan, Research Computing, University of Colorado

### Description: 
Would you like to be able to move, share or publish your software without worrying whether it will work properly on other computers? Containerization is an OS-level virtualization method used to deploy and run distributed applications without launching an entire virtual machine for each app. Containers are "stand-alone", enabling workflows to be easily packaged and shared across platforms, enhancing reproducibility and portability. This hands-on tutorial by CU Research Computing staff will provide an introduction to containers and the basics of building and running containers with Docker (first part of workshop) and Singularity (second part of workshop). Singularity is containerization software used on high performance computing platforms where users do not have escalated privileges.

__Agenda__
* 10:00-12:15: Docker
* 12:15-1:15: Break
* 1:15-3:00: Singularity

### Prerequisites: 

Please bring a laptop with the following software pre-installed:

__Docker__: Instructions for installing Docker on Mac, Windows or Linux machines can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aji-Asc0eOGBYqRIFPO39R8RZfn9xcJ6RhPLjTc8C8g/edit?usp=sharing).
* _Note: it is not necessary to install Singularity for this workshop_

__Secure Shell (SSH) client software__:  If you have Mac OS, this is already installed (via the "Terminal" application).  If you have Windows, there are many options such as [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org) and [GitBASH](https://gitforwindows.org).
